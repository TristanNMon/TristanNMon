Hi ðŸ‘‹, I'm Tristan

I am a passionate CS & ML student at Mines Paris - PSL. This year I am following the 

ðŸŒŸ Projects:

Gene Regulatory Network and Stochastic Modeling of Cell State Transitions
  - Institution: NYU Langone Health
  - Duration: February 2025 â€“ August 2025
  - Highlights:
    - Developed stochastic models to simulate transitions between cell states
    - Implemented Deep Learning Gene Regulatory Network approach 
    - Presented a poster at the Annual NYU Biology Retreat
    - Contributing author on a manuscript currently in preparation

Short-Term Active Power Loss Forecasting Algorithm for the Swiss High-Voltage Network
- Institution: Swissgrid AG
- Duration: August 2024 â€“ January 2025
- Highlights:
  - Developed and tested predictive models (LightGBM, LSTM) using high-dimensional operational data
  - Designed and implemented an MLOps workflow for model deployment and monitoring
  - Conducted peer code reviews (PRs) to ensure model reproducibility and maintainability

Generative Models
- Independent Side Project â€” Exploring and implementing core concepts behind modern generative models (VAEs, GANs, Diffusion Models).

Language Models (MVA Course)
- Documenting and sharing my journey to understand how large language models work at a deeper, architectural level via the labs completed during the course
